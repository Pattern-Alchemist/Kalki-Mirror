Task: Persistence split — static corpus DB + Turso-ready dynamic DB

Work Log:
- Identified critical production blocker: Vercel serverless filesystem is read-only; SQLite writes (User, Streaks, Keys) evaporate between invocations
- Installed @prisma/adapter-libsql + @libsql/client for Turso connection
- Created src/lib/static-db.ts: cold-start loader that copies baked db/custom.db to /tmp/kalki-corpus.db on Vercel, PrismaClient singleton for read-only FolioChunk queries, getCorpusStats() health check
- Refactored src/lib/db.ts: createPrismaClient() factory that routes to Turso via PrismaLibSql adapter when TURSO_DATABASE_URL + TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN are set, falls back to local SQLite in dev
- Re-pointed src/lib/rag/retrieval.ts from `db` to `staticDb` — all FolioChunk reads now go through the baked corpus client
- Fixed /api/keys/route.ts and /api/keys/redeem/route.ts: replaced inline `new PrismaClient()` with shared `db` singleton from @/lib/db
- Updated .env with TURSO_DATABASE_URL/TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN placeholders
- Updated prisma/schema.prisma header with full persistence split documentation
- Verified: 279 FolioChunks read correctly through staticDb, two-pool retrieval works (prescription=4, citation=4), /api/initiate returns 200 in 252ms with grounded dossier (7 folio blocks, method=grounded)

Stage Summary:
- Architecture: static corpus (baked SQLite, 279 chunks, read-only) + dynamic runtime (Turso/libSQL for production, local SQLite for dev)
- New files: src/lib/static-db.ts
- Modified files: src/lib/db.ts, src/lib/rag/retrieval.ts, src/app/api/keys/route.ts, src/app/api/keys/redeem/route.ts, prisma/schema.prisma, .env
- No migration needed for Turso: set TURSO_DATABASE_URL + TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN in Vercel env vars and prisma db push
- Next: Day 4 Dossier UI, then Days 5-6 Pulse (needs Turso live for streak writes)

Task: Ingest Tantra archive (Horizon 5 — The Archive) and build archetype taxonomy

Work Log:
- Examined Tantra_compress.zip (41 PDFs) and Images_tantra.zip (53 JPEGs) from /home/z/my-project/upload/
- Extracted Images_tantra.zip to /tmp, selected 23 best resonating images by resolution and thematic match
- Copied images to /public/assets/tantra/archetypes/ — one per Mahāvidyā + supplementary archetype + vault/sealed imagery
- Created /src/lib/data/archetypes.ts — 16 archetypes (10 Mahāvidyās + 6 supplementary), each with pattern taxonomy, bija, caution level, tier access, connected siddhis and patterns
- Created /src/lib/data/siddhis-supplementary.ts — 7 new siddhis from Tantra_compress.zip PDFs (Nyāsa, Personalized Bīja, 5 Rare Breath, Agni Māraṇa, Stambhana-Māraṇa, Vīrudha-Āhāra Māraṇa, Nimbu Mantra)
- Extended Siddhi type with cautionLevel, subcategory, archetypeId fields
- Wired supplementary siddhis into allSiddhis (now 48 total)
- Created CautionBadge component (OPEN/MODERATE/HIGH/SEALED with Cinnabar for HIGH)
- Created AcknowledgmentGate modal (friction-as-reverence for HIGH/SEALED, vault icon, crimson styling)
- Rebuilt /archive page as reading-room ledger: caution-level badges, tier filters, archetype category filters, Museum Minimalism, Mahāvidyā teaser grid at bottom
- Rebuilt /archive/[slug] folio page: archetype classification section, CautionBadge in header, AcknowledgmentGate wrapping HIGH/SEALED content, no CTA on SEALED, archetype-linked patterns
- Created /archetypes page: interactive 2-column Mahāvidyā cards with images, expandable detail panels showing description + bija + connected folios + mirror method patterns, supplementary archetypes grid
- Created /api/initiate route: chains transits → pattern-match → archetype classification → prescribed sādhana → returns single Dossier JSON
- Added Archetypes link to SacredNav and SacredFooter
- Wired patterns/[slug] to show Mahāvidyā archetype classification card
- Build passes clean: 21 routes, 0 errors

Stage Summary:
- 48 siddhis now in the archive (was 41), 7 new from Tantra_compress.zip
- 16 archetypes (10 Mahāvidyās + 6 supplementary) as YANTRA's pattern taxonomy
- 23 archetype-specific images in /public/assets/tantra/archetypes/
- Safety layer: AcknowledgmentGate on HIGH/SEALED, no CTA on SEALED, YANTRA constrained to OPEN-tier sādhana only in /api/initiate
- Brand promise 'Where Forbidden Knowledge Meets Pattern Intelligence' is now architectural
